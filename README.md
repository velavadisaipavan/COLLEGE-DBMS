These are the steps i have followed in my project

For the queries refer DDL.sqlfile

PHASE 1: BASIC QUERIES 
Exercise 1.1: List all Computer Science students
Exercise 1.2: Find courses with capacity > 50
Exercise 1.3:Show faculty with Professor designation

PHASE 2: JOIN OPERATIONS 
Exercise 2.1: Student enrollments with course names and grades
Exercise 2.2: Courses with faculty names and departments
Exercise 2.3: All students with their enrollment count

PHASE 3: AGGREGATE QUERIES 
Exercise 3.1: Count students by department and gender
Exercise 3.2: Average credits by department
Exercise 3.3: Courses with high enrollment (> 80% capacity)

PHASE 4: ANALYSIS & INSIGHTS 
Exercise 4.1: Grade distribution by department
Exercise 4.2: Faculty workload analysis
Exercise 4.3: Department performance summary

PHASE 5: Summary of the insights you find and recommendations if any.
